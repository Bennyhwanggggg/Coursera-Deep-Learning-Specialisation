# Deep Learning Specialisation

This repository contains my work for the Deep Learning specialization courses by [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) on Coursera.

This specialisation contains five courses which can be taken on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The five courses titles are:

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization.
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects.
4. Convolutional Neural Networks.
5. Sequence Models.
